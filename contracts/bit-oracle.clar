;; Title: BitOracle - Decentralized Bitcoin Price Prediction Markets
;;
;; Summary: A trustless prediction market protocol built on Stacks Layer 2
;; enabling users to stake STX tokens on Bitcoin price movements with
;; transparent, oracle-verified settlement mechanisms.
;;
;; Description: BitOracle creates time-bounded prediction markets where
;; participants can stake STX on whether Bitcoin's price will rise or fall
;; within specific timeframes. The protocol uses authorized oracles for
;; price resolution, implements proportional payout distribution among
;; winners, and charges minimal platform fees. Built for the Stacks
;; ecosystem to leverage Bitcoin's security while enabling DeFi innovation.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Decentralized price prediction markets
;; - Oracle-based Bitcoin price resolution  
;; - Proportional winning distribution
;; - Configurable market parameters
;; - Layer 2 scaling on Bitcoin via Stacks
